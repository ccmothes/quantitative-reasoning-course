# Data Visualization in R

```{r incldue = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk(eval = TRUE)

```

This lesson will go a little deeper into data visualization and how to customize figures and tables and make them 'publication ready'.

First start by reading in the packages for this lesson:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #which includes ggplot2
library(plotly) # for interactive plots
library(tmap) # interactive and static maps
library(sf) # to manage spatial data to make maps
library(tigris) # to import census tract spatial data
```

### Data Preparation

For today's lesson we are going to be working with some census data for Larimer County, CO. This data can be found on Canvas in .csv format titled `larimer_census.csv`. Download that file and put it in your `data/` folder in the R Project you will be using for this lesson.

After that, read the .csv into your R session:

```{r}
census_data <- read_csv("data/larimer_census.csv")
```

Inspect `census_data` and the structure of the data frame. This data contains information on median income, median age, and race and ethnicity for each census tract in Larimer County.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Note: This census data for Larimer county was retrieved entirely in R using the `tidycensus` package. If you are interested in how I did this, I've uploaded the script to do so on Canvas titled 'getCensusData.R'. Note that you will need to retrieve your own census API key and paste it at the top of the script to run it (API keys are free and easy to get [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)). To learn more about `tidycensus`, check out [Analyzing U.S. Census Data](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Kyle Walker.
:::

In the second half of this lesson we will be making maps, so we will need to retrieve spatial data in the form of census tract polygons for Larimer County. We can use the `tigris` package you used in the [Introduction to Spatial Data lesson](07-spatial.Rmd) to import a Larimer County census tract shapefile. We also want to just keep the `GEOID` column, as it will make our data join later on cleaner (i.e., we only need to keep the spatial data and an ID column).

```{r}
larimer_tracts <- tracts(state = "CO", county = "Larimer") %>% 
  select(GEOID)
```

Now in order to visualize our census tract attributes spatially, we need to join the `census_data` to `larimer_tracts`. We use the function `full_join()`, specify the two variables we want to join, and specify the name of the column in each that we want to join by (i.e., the column that is consistent between the two). In this case we want to use the column `GEOID`, which is a unique number given to each census tract in the US.

We want to create a new variable that will become an `sf` object we can map with `tmap` later.

```{r}
census_spatial <- full_join(larimer_tracts, census_data, by = ("GEOID"))
```

When you inspect this output, you can see that it is a spatial `sf` multipolygon object, where the data is exactly the same as our `census_data` data frame but now there is a geometry column/attribute tied to it.

## Publication Ready Figures with `ggplot2`

For this exercise you will learn how to spruce up your `ggplot2` figures with theme customization, annotation, color palettes, and more.

To demonstrate some of these advanced visualization techniques, we will be analyzing the relationships among some census data for Larimer county.

Let's start with this basic plot:

```{r}
census_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent))+
  geom_point()
```

And by the end of this lesson turn it into this:

![](images/census_plot.png)

### General Appearance

*Note that these customizations will vary depending on what `geom_`* *you are using.*

#### Customize points within `geom_point()`

-   color or size points by a variable or apply a specific color/number

-   change the transparency with `alpha` (ranges from 0-1)

```{r}
#specific color and size value
census_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent))+
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 4, alpha = 0.5)
```

When sizing or coloring points by a variable in the dataset, it goes within `aes():`

```{r}
# size by a variable
census_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent))+
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income), color = "red")
```

```{r}
# color by a variable
census_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent))+
  geom_point(aes(color = median_income), size = 4)
```

#### Titles and limits

-   add title with `ggtitle`

-   edit axis labels with `xlab()` and `ylab()`

-   change axis limits with `xlim()` and `ylim()`

```{r}
census_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent))+
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income))+
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County")+
  xlab("Median Age")+
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  xlim(c(20, 70))+
  ylim(c(0, 35))
```

Be cautious of setting the axis limits however, as you notice it omits the full dataset which could lead to dangerous misinterpretations of the data.

You can also put multiple label arguments within `labs()` like this:

```{r}
census_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent))+
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income))+
  labs(
    title = "Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County",
    x = "Median Age",
    y = "People of Color (%)"
  ) +
  xlim(c(20, 70))+
  ylim(c(0, 35))
```

#### Chart components with `theme()`

All `ggplot2` components can be customized within the `theme()` function. The full list of editable components (there's a lot!) can be found [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html). Note that the functions used within `theme()` depend on the type of components, such as `element_text()` for text, `element_line()` for lines, etc.

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)") +
  theme(
    #edit plot title
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, color = "blue"),
    # edit x axis title
    axis.title.x = element_text(face = "italic", color = "orange"),
    # edit y axis ticks
    axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
    # edit grid lines
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "black"),

  )
```

Another change you may want to make is the value breaks in the axis labels (i.e., what values are shown on the axis). To customize that for a continuous variable you can use `scale_x_continuous()` / `scale_y_continuous` (for discrete variables use `scale_x_discrete` ). In this example we will also add `anlge =` to our axis text to able the labels so they are not too jumbled:

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 90, 5))+
  theme(
    # angle axis labels
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)
  )
```

While these edits aren't necessarily *pretty*, we are just demonstrating how you would edit specific components of your charts. To edit overall aesthetics of your plots you can change the theme.

#### Themes

`ggplot2` comes with many built in theme options (see the complete list [here](https://r-graph-gallery.com/192-ggplot-themes)).

For example, see what `theme_minimal()` and `theme_classic()` look like:

```{r}
# bw theme
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  theme_classic()
```

You can also import many different themes by installing certain packages. A popular one is `ggthemes`. A complete list of themes with this package can be seen [here](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/)

To run this example, first install the `ggthemes` package and then load it in to your session:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggthemes")
```

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
```

Now explore a few themes, such as `theme_wsj`, which uses the Wall Street Journal theme, and `theme_economist` and `theme_economist_white` to use themes used by the Economist,

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  ggthemes::theme_wsj()
```

This one looks quite messy out of the box, but you can apply any elements from `theme()` afterwards. For example, change the legend position:

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  ggthemes::theme_wsj()+
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

Note you may need to click 'Zoom' in the Plot window to view the figure better.

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  ggthemes::theme_economist()
```

### Color, Size and Legends

#### Color

To specify a single color, the most common way is to specify the name (e.g., `"red"`) or the Hex code (e.g., `"#69b3a2"`).

You can also specify an entire color palette. Some of the most common packages to work with color palettes in R are `RColorBrewer` and [`viridis`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html). Viridis is designed to be color-blind friendly, and RColorBrewer has a [web application](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) where you can explore your data requirements and preview various palettes.

First, if you want to run these examples install the `RColorBrewer` and `viridis` packages:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("viridis")

```

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
library(viridis)
```

Now, lets color our points using the palettes in `viridis`. To customize continuous color scales with `viridis` we use `scale_color_viridis()`.

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  viridis::scale_colour_viridis()
```

Second, let's see how to do that with an `RColorBrewer` palette, using the 'Greens' palette and `scale_color_distiller()` function. We add `direction = 1` to make it so that darker green is associated with higher values for income.

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Greens", direction = 1)
```

#### Size

You can edit the range of the point radius with `scale_radius` :

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Greens", direction = 1)+
  scale_radius(range = c(0.5, 6))
  
```

#### Legends

In the previous plots we notice that two separate legends are created for size and color. To create one legend where the circles are colored, we use `guides()` like this, specifying the same title for color and size:

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "BuGn", direction = 1)+
  scale_radius(range = c(2, 6))+
  theme_minimal()+
  #customize legend
  guides(color= guide_legend(title = "Median Income"), size=guide_legend(title = "Median Income"))
```

### Annotation

Annotation is the process of adding text, or 'notes' to your charts. Say we wanted to highlight some details to specific points in our data, for example some of the outliers.

When investigating the outlying point with the highest median age and high percentage of people of color, it turns out that census tract includes Rocky Mountain National Park and the surrounding area, and also the total population of that tract is only 53. Lets add these details to our chart with `annotate()`. This function requires several arguments:

-   `geom`: type of annotation, most often `text`

-   `x`: position on the x axis to put the annotation

-   `y`: position on the y axis to put the annotation

-   `label`: what you want the annotation to say

-   Optional: `color`, `size`, `angle`, and more.

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)")+
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "BuGn", direction = 1)+
  scale_radius(range = c(2, 6))+
  theme_minimal()+
  guides(color= guide_legend(title = "Median Income"), size=guide_legend(title = "Median Income"))+
  # add annotation
  annotate(geom = "text", x=76, y = 62,
           label = "Rocky Mountain National Park region \n Total Populaion: 53")
```

We can also add an arrow to point at the data point the annotation is referring to with `geom_curve` and a few other arguments like so:

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income)) +
  ggtitle("Census Tract socioeconomic data for Larimer County") +
  xlab("Median Age") +
  ylab("People of Color (%)") +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "BuGn", direction = 1) +
  scale_radius(range = c(2, 6)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Median Income"),
         size = guide_legend(title = "Median Income")) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = 74,
           y = 62,
           label = "Rocky Mountain National Park region \n Total Populaion: 53") +
  # add arrow
  geom_curve(
    aes(
      x = 82,
      xend = 88,
      y = 60,
      yend = 57.5
    ),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
    size = 0.5,
    curvature = -0.3
  )
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Note that with annotations you may need to mess around with the x and y positions to get it just right. Also, the preview you see in the 'plot' window may look jumbled and viewing it by clicking 'Zoom' can help.

### Finalize and save

We are almost done with this figure. I am going to add/change a few more elements below. Feel free to add your own!

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income), alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(
    title = "Socioeconomic data for Larimer County",
    subtitle = "Median age, median income, and percentage of people of color for each census tract",
    x = "Median Age",
    y = "People of Color (%)",
    caption = "Data obtained from the U.S. Census 5-year American Community Survey Samples for 2017-2021"
  )+
  scale_radius(range = c(2, 6)) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_viridis() + #use the Viridis palette
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Median Income"),
         size = guide_legend(title = "Median Income")) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = 15, margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, margin = unit(c(-0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), "cm")),
    plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", hjust = -1),
    plot.title.position = "plot", #sets the title to the left
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = 74,
           y = 62,
           label = "Rocky Mountain National Park region \n Total Populaion: 53",
           size = 2) +
  geom_curve(
    aes(
      x = 82,
      xend = 88,
      y = 60,
      yend = 57.5
    ),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
    size = 0.5,
    curvature = -0.3
  )
```

**Want to make it dark theme?**

`ggdark` is a fun package to easily convert your figures to various dark themes. If you want to test it out, install the package and try `dark_theme_classic()` instead of `theme_classic()` in the previous figure:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggdark")
```

```{r}
library(ggdark)
```

```{r}
census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income), alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(
    title = "Socioeconomic data for Larimer County",
    subtitle = "Median age, median income, and percentage of people of color for each census tract",
    x = "Median Age",
    y = "People of Color (%)",
    caption = "Data obtained from the U.S. Census 5-year American Community Survey Samples for 2017-2021"
  )+
  scale_radius(range = c(2, 6)) +
  dark_theme_classic() +
  scale_color_viridis() + #use the Viridis palette
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Median Income"),
         size = guide_legend(title = "Median Income")) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = 15, margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, margin = unit(c(-0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), "cm")),
    plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", hjust = -1),
    plot.title.position = "plot", #sets the title to the left
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = 74,
           y = 62,
           label = "Rocky Mountain National Park region \n Total Populaion: 53",
           size = 2) +
  geom_curve(
    aes(
      x = 82,
      xend = 88,
      y = 60,
      yend = 57.5
    ),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm")),
    size = 0.5,
    curvature = -0.3
  )
```

**Saving with `ggsave`**

You can save your plot in the "Plots" pane by clicking "Export", or you can also do it programmatically with `ggsave()`, which also lets you customize the output file a little more. Note that you can give the argument a variable name of a ggplot object, or **by default it will save the last plot in the "Plots" pane**.

```{r}
#specify the file path and name, and height/width (if necessary)
ggsave(filename = "data/census_plot.png", width = 6, height = 5, units = "in")
```

#### Want to make it interactive?

Remember the use of the `plotly` package and the `ggplotly()` function from previous lessons. We can put our entire ggplot code above inside `ggplotly()` below:

```{r}
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
ggplotly(census_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = non_white_percent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = median_income, color = median_income), alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(
    title = "Socioeconomic data for Larimer County",
    subtitle = "Median age, median income, and percentage of people of color for each census tract",
    x = "Median Age",
    y = "People of Color (%)",
    caption = "Data obtained from the U.S. Census 5-year American Community Survey Samples for 2017-2021"
  )+
  scale_radius(range = c(2, 6)) +
  dark_theme_classic() +
  scale_color_viridis() + #use the Viridis palette
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Median Income"),
         size = guide_legend(title = "Median Income")) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size = 15, margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, margin = unit(c(-0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5), "cm")),
    plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", hjust = -1),
    plot.title.position = "plot", #sets the title to the left
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8)
  ))
```

Note that we removed the annotations as `plotly` doesn't yet support them.

## Publication Ready Maps with `tmap`

You used `tmap` in the [Introduction to Spatial Data lesson](07-spatial.Rmd). Let's use it here to visualize the spatial patterns of our Larimer County census data, and learn how to customize the map to make it 'Publication Ready'.

To run these examples, make sure you have created the `census_spatial` object at the beginning of this lesson in the 'Data Preparation' section.

```{r}
#set the tmap mode to static
tmap_mode("plot")
```

```{r}
qtm(census_spatial, fill = "median_income")
```

## Publication Ready Tables with [`flextable`](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/)

While tables aren't necessarily always grouped in to the 'data visualization' discussion (but check out [these awesome tables](https://ardata.fr/en/flextable-gallery/) made with the `flextable` package!), this section will provide a quick example of creating publication ready tables you can render in your Word documents.

To make tables that can render in a Word document, you can use the `flextable` package. If you want to test it out, install and load the package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("flextable")
```

```{r}
library(flextable)
```

Using the `flextable` package, rendering nicely formatted tables is pretty simple by feeding a data frame into the `flextable()` argument. Normally you don't want a table with 50+ rows in it (publication tables are meant to summarize), so let's make a quick table showing some summary information of income, age and race for the top 5 wealthiest census tracts.

We can clean our data and then pipe it into `flextable()` to create the rendered table:

```{r}
census_data %>% 
  arrange(-median_income) %>% 
  filter(median_income > 145000) %>% 
  select(NAME, median_income:Hispanic) %>% 
  flextable()
```

In addition to cleaning and formatting your data with `dplyr` functions before creating the flextable (e.g., edit column names, round numeric values), there are a ton of ways you can customize the flextable objects with various `flextable` functions. Check out the [flextable book](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/) for more details.
