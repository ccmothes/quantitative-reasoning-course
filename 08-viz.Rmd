# Data Visualization in R

This lesson will go a little deeper into data visualization and how to customize figures and tables and make them 'publication ready'.

First start by reading in the packages for this lesson:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #which includes ggplot2
library(plotly) # for interactive plots
library(tmap) # interactive and static maps
library(sf) # to manage spatial data to make maps
```

We will also be learning how to include tables in your rendered documents, and will need a new package called `gt` to do so.

Run the following line of code in the console OR comment it out in your workflow after executing it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gt")
```

Then after successful installation, call the `gt` package in to your session:

```{r}
library(gt)
```

## Publication Ready Figures with `ggplot2`

## Interactive charts with `plotly`

## (maybe) Publication Ready Maps with `tmap`

## Publication Ready Tables with `gt`
