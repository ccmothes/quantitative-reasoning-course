# Introduction to R and RStudio

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE)
```

## Getting to know RStudio

When you first open RStudio, it is split into 3 panels:

-   **The Console** (left), where you can directly type and run code (by hitting Enter)
-   **The Environment/History pane** (upper-right), where you can view the objects you currently have stored in your environment and a history of the code you've run
-   **The Files/Plots/Packages/Help pane** (lower-right), where you can search for files, view and save your plots, view and manage what packages are loaded in your library and session, and get R help

To write and save code you use scripts. You can open a new script with File -\> New File or by clicking the icon with the green plus sign in the upper left corner. When you open a script, RStudio then opens a fourth **'Source' panel** in the upper-left to write and save your code. You can also send code from a script directly to the console to execute it by highlighting the code line/chunk (or place your cursor at the end of the code chunk) and hit CTRL+ENTER on a PC or CMD+ENTER on a Mac.

It is good practice to add comments/notes throughout your scripts to document what the code is doing. To do this start a line with a `#`. R knows to ignore everything after a `#`, so you can write whatever you want there.

## R Projects

As a first step whenever you start a new project, workflow, analysis, etc., it is good practice to set up an R project. R Projects are RStudio's way of bundling together all your files for a specific project, such as data, scripts, results, figures. Your project directory also becomes your working directory, so everything is self-contained and easily portable.

We recommend using a single R Project for this course, so lets create one now.

You can start an R project in an existing directory or in a new one. To create a project go to File -\> New Project:

![](images/project-start.png)

Let's choose 'New Directory' then 'New Project'. Now choose a directory name, this will be both the folder name and the project name, so use proper spelling conventions (no spaces!). We recommend naming it something course specific, like 'ESS-330-2023'. Choose where on your local file system you want to save this new folder/project, then click 'Create Project'.

Now you can see your RStudio session is working in the R project you just created. You can see the working directory printed at the top of your console is now the project directory, and in the 'Files' tab in RStudio you can see there is an .Rproj file with the same name as the R project, which will open up this R project in RStudio whenever you come back to it.

**Test out how this .Rproj file works**. Close out of your R session, navigate to the project folder on your computer, and double-click the .Rproj file.

***What is a working directory?***

## Write your first script

Let's start coding!

The first thing you do in a fresh R session and at the beginning of a workfow is set up your environment, which mostly includes installing and loading necessary libraries and reading in required data sets. Let's open a fresh R script and save it in our root (project) directory. Call this script someting like 'r-intro.R'.

### Commenting code

It is best practice to add comments throughout your code noting what you are doing at each step. This is helpful for both future you (say you forgot what a chunk of code is doing after returning to it months later) and for others you may share your code with.

To comment out code you use a `#`. You can use as many `#`'s as you want, any thing you write on that line after at least one `#` will be read as a comment and R will know to ignore that and not try to execute it as code.

At the top of your script, write some details about the script like a title, your name and date.

```{r}
# Introduction to R and RStudio
# your name
# date
```

Now for the rest of this lesson, write all the code in this script you just created. You can execute code from a script (i.e., send it from the script to the console) in various ways (see below). Think of these scripts as your code notes, you can write and execute code, add notes throughout, and then save it and come back to it whenever you want.

### Executing Code

Almost always you will start a script by installing and/or loading all the libraries/packages you need for that workflow. Add the following lines of code to your script to import our R packages you should have already installed from the [R Setup](01-R-setup.Rmd) page.

```{r}
#load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

To execute code you can either highlight the entire line(s) of code you want to run and click the 'Run' button in the upper-right of the Source pane or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Enter on Windows or CMD+Enter on Macs.

You can also place your cursor at the very end of the line or chunk of code you want to run and hit CTRL+Enter or CMD+Enter.

***NOTE:*** All functions and other code chunks must properly close all parentheses or brackets to execute. If you have an un-closed parentheses/bracket you will get stuck in a never ending loop and will keep seeing `+` printed in the console. To get out of this loop you can either close the parentheses or bracket, or hit ESC to start over. You want to make sure you see the `>` in the console and not the `+` to execute code.

### Functions

R has many built in functions to perform various tasks. To run these functions you type the function name followed by parentheses. Within the parentheses you put in your specific arguments needed to run the function.

Practice running these various functions and see what output is printed in the console.

```{r}
# mathematical functions with numbers
log(10)

# average a range of numbers
mean(1:5)

# nested functions for a string of numbers, using the concatenate function 'c'
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))


# functions with characters
print("Hello World")

paste("Hello", "World", sep = "-")
```

#### Base R vs. The Tidyverse

You may hear the terms 'Base R' and 'Tidyverse' a lot throughout this course. Base R includes functions that are installed with the R software and do not require the installation of additional packages to use them. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization that you are likely to use in every day data analysis, and all use the same design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. When you install the Tidyverse, it installs all of these packages, and you can then load all of them in your R session with `library(tidyverse)`. Base R and Tidyverse have many similar functions, but many prefer the style, efficiency and functionality of the Tidyverse packages, and we will mostly be sticking to Tidyverse functions for this course.

### Data Types

#### Indexing

### Reading data into R

### Exercises

*Adapt these to work with the survey data they created in the spreadsheets lab*

1.  Why don't the following lines of code work? Tweak each one so the code runs (10 pts)

    ```{r}
    myList["Fruit"]
    ```

    ```{r}
    penguins$flipper_lenght_mm
    ```

    ```{r}
    penguins[island=='Dream',]
    ```

2.  How many species are in the `penguins` dataset? What islands were the data collected for? (Note: the `unique()` function might help) (5 pts).

3.  Create a new data frame that has columns for species, island and flipper length, but just for the Dream island. (5 pts).

4.  What is the average flipper length for the Adelie species on Dream island? (Note: explore the `mean()` function and how to deal with NA values). (5 pts).
